# Frontend Mentor - Interactive card details form solution

## Overwiev

This repository holds my solution to the [Interactive card details form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw). Frontend Mentor challenges are frontend exercices where you can test yourself, improve your coding or generally try new things while building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge here was to build a form that updates in real-time while the user provides his card details. The form must obviously inform the user if any fields are filled incorrectly or empty.
Additionally, the form must adapt to the user's device screen size.

## How it went

Actually, I completed the challenge twice, first with just JS and then using React. In my judgement React won this round, as creating controlled inputs turned out to be much easier here. Another fun thing in this challenge was a chance to get your hands dirty with regex which - to me at least - seems simple and is simple just until the time I need to use it myself. Overall I must say that I enjoyed it and rate this challenge as a 10/10 fun challenge.
